/// <b>What this is.</b> A floor. It is word matching, it has no understanding of context or

/// <b>Why two outcomes rather than one.</b> Blocking everything risky would break the product.
/// "Rats", "food poisoning" and "shut down by the health department" are ordinary content in a
/// one-star restaurant review — which is precisely the material this app mines — and refusing
/// them would refuse the app's best comics. But the same sentence, restated by a model as a
/// claim about a named business, is defamation-shaped. So allegation language is <b>flagged</b>:
/// it publishes and lands in the moderation queue for a human. Only the categories with no
/// legitimate reading — sexual content involving minors, slurs — are <b>blocked</b>, before the
/// paid image call.

/// <b>Replacing it.</b> Azure AI Content Safety implements this interface directly: a hosted
/// classifier returns severity per category, which maps onto Allow/Flag/Block without any caller
/// changing. That swap needs a resource, an endpoint and a key in Key Vault, so it is a
/// deployment decision rather than a code one — the seam is here and ready.
