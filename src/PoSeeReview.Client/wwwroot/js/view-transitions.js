// Cross-fade between routes using the View Transitions API, plus a shared-element morph from a
// tapped restaurant card into the comic view.
//
// Blazor's router does not integrate with document.startViewTransition, and there is no hook that
// brackets "DOM is about to change" / "DOM has changed". So this drives it from navigation
// instead: intercept the click on an internal link, snapshot the current document, let Blazor
// navigate, and end the transition once the new route has painted.
//
// Deliberately conservative:
//   * Unsupported browsers get today's hard cut. No polyfill, no JS-driven fade — a hand-rolled
//     crossfade of a whole SPA is exactly the kind of thing that fights the compositor.
//   * prefers-reduced-motion disables it outright. A full-page cross-fade is precisely the
//     "large moving content" reduced-motion exists to suppress.
//   * A safety timeout always resolves the transition. If Blazor throws mid-navigation, an
//     unresolved startViewTransition leaves the page frozen under a snapshot — a blank app.
