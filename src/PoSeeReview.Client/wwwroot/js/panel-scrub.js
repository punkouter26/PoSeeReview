// Reading the comic plays it.
//
// The strip is a single <img> of stacked panels. Scrolling past it fires one note of that
// comic's own motif per panel as the panel crosses the middle of the screen — so the figure the
// score reveal played as a burst is re-heard, spread out, at the pace the reader chose.
//
// WHY THE VISUAL HALF IS NOT IN THIS FILE.
//
// The travelling highlight that goes with this is `animation-timeline: view()` in app.css, and it
// is there rather than here because the compositor can run it off the main thread. This module
// does only the part CSS cannot do: notice that a boundary was crossed and make a sound.
//
// WHY AN IntersectionObserver AND NOT A SCROLL HANDLER.
//
// A scroll handler fires continuously and would have to compute geometry on every event, on the
// same thread as the rest of the effects layer. An observer fires only on a crossing — two or
// four times for the whole page — and costs nothing in between. This is the case the API exists
// for; the reason app.css prefers view() for the FADE is that a fade is continuous, and this is
// not.
//
// The sentinels are zero-height absolutely-positioned divs, one per panel, laid down the strip.
// Observing the image itself would only say "the strip is visible", which is one event for the
// whole thing and cannot tell panel one from panel two.
